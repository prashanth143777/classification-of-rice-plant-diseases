# Detection and Classification of Rice Plant disease by using Machine Learning

Agriculture is the most important sector of Indian economy. Detection of plant diseases plays an important role in agricultural field using image processing automatic techniques.  It reduces the large amount of work and time for monitoring big forms of crops. The Image segmentation and Neural networks are used for automatic detection and classification of plant leaves. It takes the image as input, and apply techniques to that image like pre-processing, segmentation and then the input is given to the Convolution neural network in order to classify the disease.
